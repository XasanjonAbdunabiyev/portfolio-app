        In 2021, I started the frontend course at <span className="font-medium">Albison Academy</span> on a grand basis and successfully completed the course and participated in several community projects. I have mentioned what technologies I know I am currently looking for a full time job as a software developer.
        When I'm not coding, I enjoy playing video games, watching movies, and learning new things. I am also currently learning backend programming. My plan now is to become a full-stack in the short term.
